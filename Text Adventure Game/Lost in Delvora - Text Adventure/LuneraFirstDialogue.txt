Lunera says: "Hi, so glad you're awake! I'm Lunera. You might wonder where you are right now, but that doesn't matter right now. I need your help."
She walks towards the table and sits next to the man and point at the chair across from her.
As you sit down she adds: "As you might see, we're not the wealthiest of families, but there is a way to fix that. Unfortunately the fix for the problem lies deep within the mines."
With a quick glance towards the man sitting next to her she then continues: "We're not allowed down in the mines for certain reasons, even though this would fix all of our problems..."

The man gives Lunera a stern glance as he put down his cutlery.
"We don't need any help from anyone." mutters the man underneath his big beard.

Without even listening to the man, Lunera continues: "I know this is a lot to ask from a complete stranger" she slowly caress your arm and look at you with a soft smile. Suddenly you are aware of how beautiful she is.
"Would you be so kind as to fetch some gold from the mines?"
With a dumbstruck face you just sit there and stare at Lunera.
"Lovely!" she gets out of her chair and rush over to your side and hugs you. As she hugs you she softly whispers in your ear:"I'll give you a great reward if you do this for me".
She smiles at you and then rushes up the stairs and disappear.
When you finally come to your senses you are even more confused than before.

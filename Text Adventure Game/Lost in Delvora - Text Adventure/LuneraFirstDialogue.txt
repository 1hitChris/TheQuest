Lunera says: "Hi, so glad you're awake! I'm Lunera. You might wonder where you are right now, but that doesn't matter right now. I need your help."
Lunera pulls out a chair and sits down and points to another chair across from her. 
She adds: "There's something in the mine that i need, but i'm not allowed to go down there. If i do, Papa will punish me."
She reach out with her arms and reveals a lot of scars.

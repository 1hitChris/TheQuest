$0...the smell of butter and cooked meat fills the kitchen while you get a bottle of wine and pour it into the pan, the aroma is almost to much to bare and you catch yourself drooling.
When it's all done you sit down at the table in front of the tv and devour all food in just a couple of minutes. After you're done, you take out the trash and as you throw them away, something hits the ground.
A small piece of bone...looking like it's from a human arm, but it's way to small to be from an adult...

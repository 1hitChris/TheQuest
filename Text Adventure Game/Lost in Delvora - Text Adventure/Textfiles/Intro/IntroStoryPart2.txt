The woman in front of you smiles and gestures to sit down at the empty chair next to the boy with the big body.
$2"Come on everyone, introduce yourselves!"$0 she says as she sits down across from you.
The boy on the right side of the table looks at you, with what you could only describe as disgust. $3"Wilbert"$0 he says as he stands up and walks out of the house with a fast pace.
The girl next to him looks at him, stands up and looks at you. She don't utter a word, instead she bows towards you and follow the boy out of the house.
$2"That was Wilbert and Evalina, please excuse Wilbert. He means well...i think"$0 she then looks over towards the small boy, waiting for his answer.
$5"Gillhardt..."$0 you are suprised by the deep voice coming from this small boy and stares at him in awe.
Looking over at the boy next to you as he stuffs his mouth full of bread as he tries to get some form of words out.
$6"G.s...f"$0 mumbeling through all the food it is hard to make out what he said and you look over towards the woman in hope that she will clarify what was just said.
$2"Gustof"$0 she says with a gentle voice.
$2"Why don't you boys go out and play for a while?"
$0Gillhardt don't even hesitate to head her request, but Gustof on the other hand, does as he looks at the food as he slowly make it towards the door, leaving the building.
As soon as the door shuts the woman looks over at you.
$2"I am Lunera and the grumpy old man over there is Papa. He is not as scary as he looks, so do not worry".
$0You are now alone in the house with Papa and Lunera and as you look around the room you don't see anything standing out, except a knife lying on a bench next to what you would say is the stove and a white piece of cloth hanging on the wall..

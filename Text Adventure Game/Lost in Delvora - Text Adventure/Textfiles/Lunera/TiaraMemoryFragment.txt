$0You suddenly find yourself in a familiar place. YOUR home. Looking around the apartment, it is very dirty, cloths everywhere, dirty dishes and lack of furnitures. Although in the corner you see what looks like a babycrib.
Suddenly the sharp sound of a phone ringing makes you jump and as you're trying to walk over to the phone you realise that you can't acually control your own body. As you stand there, trying to make your body listen to you, you feel a chill running down your spine and going through you is another version of you.
The other you picks up the phone and as "you" answers it, everything goes dark and you find yourself once again in front of Lunera and you can feel all the energy leave your body and you fall down on your knees.
$2"Are you feeling okay?"$0 she asks as she tries to help you get back up on your feet.
$2"Maybe you should rest a bit? Maybe get some fresh air".

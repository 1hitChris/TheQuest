We did not need your help and i stand by that still, but you have earned a reward for what you have done."$0 Papa slowly stands up and it is not until he stands up that you notice how huge this man is. Two meters? Maybe even more and with his muscular build he is even more terrifying.

$1"You have deserved this, but before you leave you need to know about what you have done. As you might have noticed already, you do not belong in this world. It is up to you, whether or not you can forgive yourself for everthing that you have caused"
"It is time to remember."$0 he opens up the bundle of cloth to reveal a mirror with only one shard of glass in it.
$1"Put all the pieces back together."$0 You take out all the fragments you have recieved and start putting them back in the mirror and as you put back the final piece, everything comes back to you.

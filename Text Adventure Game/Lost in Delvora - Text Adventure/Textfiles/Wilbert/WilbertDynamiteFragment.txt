$0...as you run out of the house, you can still hear the fuse slowly sizzling and the shrieks piercing your ears. The adrenaline keeps from stopping your feet and all you can do is run, run as fast and far as possible...and suddenly...as the noise of the fuse disappear, the time seems to stop for a couple of second, and thats when it happens...

Like a shockwave going through your entire body, you find yourself in front of Wilbert and Evalina and your body is drained of energy. It takes you a couple of minutes for you to collect yourself before carrying on.

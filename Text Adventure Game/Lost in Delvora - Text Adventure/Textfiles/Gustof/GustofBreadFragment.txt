$0...as you walk by the basement you hear the weak noise of children and as you get down you see how at least six children is sitting on the floor chained up and pushed up against the wall, as they are clearly terrified of you.
Six dirty plates lies in the middle of the floor and you start to fill them up with various types of cooked meat. Eager and starving, the kids do not hesitate to scarf down the scraps they get.
As you start walking up the stairs you look in one of the corners where there is an empty chain and plate.

Like getting punched in the stomach you topple over and find yourself on the floor of the barn. Taking a couple of minutes to collect yourself before continuing on your journey.

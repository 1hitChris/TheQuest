$0...you stand on the stool in the middle of the living room. Lights from cars passing by is the only lightsource that hits you. Taking a deep breath before you take your last step of the stool.
In the dead of the night, the silence is broken by the noise of a rope getting stretched out and something wooden hitting the floor, followed by a slow and steady creaking...

Like waking up from a bad dream, you grasp for air as you find yourself in the barn once more. Taking a minute to collect yourself before carrying on.

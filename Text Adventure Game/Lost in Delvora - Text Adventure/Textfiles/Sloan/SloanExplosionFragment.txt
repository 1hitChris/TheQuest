$0...as you sit down on the floor in front of the children, you take out a homemade bomb and put it down on the floor in front of yourself. The children looking at the abstract object lying on the floor and over to you.
One press of the red button and a countdown starts, counting down from ten.
"Ten, nine, eight..." you look at the children and ensure them that everything will be alright and their suffering will stop.
"Seven, six, five..." you look down at the bomb, filled with regret of what you have done.
"Four, three, two, one..." a smile comes across your lips...

Like waking up from a bad dream, you grasp for air as you find yourself in the barn once more. Taking a minute to collect yourself before carrying on.

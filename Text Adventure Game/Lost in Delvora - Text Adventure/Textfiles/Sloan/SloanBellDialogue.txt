$7"Zzzz....Zzzz...."$0 even as you approach nothing seems to wake her up, until you take out the bell from your bag and shake it around.
You can see the ears react to the sound of the bell and slowly the dog opens it's eyes and looks at you with very droopy eyes. The dogs stretches it's body and slowly walk away to another part of the barn, only to go back to sleep.
As you glance back where the dog was sleeping before, you notice a shard of glass at your feet and as you pick it up, your mind goes blank.
